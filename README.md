# firm_equilibrium_with_debt

## Goals
This project is a structural model for the company's investment decisions with debt. The description is written in [toymodel.pdf](https://github.com/wangshasha111/firm_equilibrium_with_debt/blob/master/toymodel.pdf).

## Motivation
The motivation for this project is to see how companies operate with debt constraints. A simple model begins with companies make investment and production decisions in the state space of capital, i.e., how much capital it holds. However in reality, the holdings of debt is another major factor affecting companies' operation decision. This model is to explore how companies invest in fact of debt holdings and constraints.

## Takeaway
The takeaway of this project is in face of the debt's state space, the curse of dimensionality ensues so that computational techniques have to be employed to ensure efficiency. Another takeaway with respect to this project is that companies' behaviors do get affected by the contraints of the debts.
